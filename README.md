This Ridge-Regression Model was created as part of a coursework project in 2023 to predict the ageing population of Singapore using https://www.singstat.gov.sg/find-data/search-by-theme/population/population-and-population-structure/latest-data.

In the process, we also coded this to learn more about Machine Learning in Python.
